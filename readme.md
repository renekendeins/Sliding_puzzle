Square puzzle is a basic game made with jQuery library. It's a very easy and funny game to play. I would like to add more levels with the time and create new functions.

Each level has its own script. In this way you can modify each level separately if you want. I think it's a easy way to understand the code for those who are begining in the programming world.

Enjoy!
